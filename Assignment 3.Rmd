## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(caret)
library(ISLR)
library(e1071)

bank<-read.csv("UniversalBank.csv")

summary(bank)
```


```{r}

set.seed(123)

Index_Train<-createDataPartition(bank$Personal.Loan,p=0.6,list = FALSE)
Train<-bank[Index_Train,]
Test<-bank[-Index_Train,]
```


```{r Question A}

library(reshape)
library(reshape2)

melted.bank=melt(Train,id=c("CreditCard","Personal.Loan"),variable="Online")
recast.bank=cast(melted.bank,CreditCard+Personal.Loan~Online)

recast.bank[,c(1:2,14)]
```


```{r Question B}
#The Probability that this customer will accept the loan offer = 91/3000 = 3.0%
```


```{r Question C}
melted.bankc1=melt(Train,id=c("Personal.Loan"),variable = "Online")
melted.bankc2=melt(Train,id=c("CreditCard"),variable = "Online")
recast.bankc1=cast(melted.bankc1,Personal.Loan~Online)
recast.bankc2=cast(melted.bankc2,CreditCard~Online)
loan.online=recast.bankc1[,c(1,13)]
loan.cc=recast.bankc2[,c(1,14)]
loan.online
loan.cc
```


```{r Question D}
table(Train[,c(14,10)])

table(Train[,c(13,10)])

table(Train[,c(10)])

#i. 91/(91+187) = 32.73%
#ii. 179/(179+112) = 64.38%
#iii. 288/(2712+288) = 9.6%
#iv. 792/(792+1930) = 29.1%
#v. 1620/(1620+1102) = 59.51%
#vi. 2712/(2712+288) = 90.4%
```


```{r Question E}

#P(Loan=1|CC=1,Online=1)
(.3273*.6438*.096)/((.3273*.6438*.096)+(.291*.5951*.904))

```


```{r Question F}

#The value obtained in the pivot table is a more acurate measurement. The naive bayes method does now need the same independent classifications to predict because of the independence assumptions.

```

```{r Question G}
library("e1071")
library("gmodels")
nb_model<-naiveBayes(Personal.Loan~Online+CreditCard,data = Train)
Predicted_Test_labels<-predict(nb_model,Test)
CrossTable(x=Test$Personal.Loan,y=Predicted_Test_labels,prop.chisq = FALSE)

#0.101 is the output from the Naive Bayes method above. it is similar to the .1144 we found in part E. the 0.101 is the entry that corresponds to P(Loan=1|CC=1,Online=1)
```
