## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r MLB Beer Prices}
mlb
```

```{r priceperounce summary}
summary(priceperounce)
```
```{r halfoffbeerprice summary}
summary(halfoffbeerprice)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot}
plot(year,priceperounce)
#the price per ounce has become more spread out over the years
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r mlb half price}
priceperounce/2
# this shows what the price per ounce would be if the teams did half-off beer night promotions
```
